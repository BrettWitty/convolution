Convolution by Brett Witty
--------------------------

This document contains various notes to ease game play and for general interest.

- horror
- violence
- adult references
- philosophy


The Plot
--------

All of a sudden you snap out of your train of thought and find yourself in what seems to be a basement. What were you thinking about? More importantly, where the heck are you?


The General Idea
----------------

Convolution is a game of exploration. Exploration of location and of theme. I've given the game a healthy dose of puzzles, but they aren't intended to tear your brain asunder. I prefer humorous or clever solutions over obscure or silly solutions. Thus you will not open doors with a carp (or will you?) but you may be able to resolve situations in unexpected ways. Feel free to push the limits.

I've designed some of puzzles to be solvable in several different ways so you can try *your* solution rather than a particular one the author would prefer. Moreover, you can avoid some puzzles completely, taking alternative routes through the game.

There are several Easter eggs hidden about the place. Try to find them all!


Bugs
----

None so far.
