Things I learnt:

- You should set nouns for the player
- How to make a sign that "sticks" to the front of a door.
- You can always cut out objects, ideas... even whole levels. I originally had something like 10 levels in the apartment block. I now have an ultra-compressed building that is less than half that size.


Things that weren't to be:
- An immovable object (to produce the philosophical conundrum of colliding an irresistible body with an immovable one). The irresistable body may have been a hot chick.
- The circular reference room
- The dark room/bomb trap
