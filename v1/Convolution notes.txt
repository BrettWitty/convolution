Theme
Initial levels should be ordinary, with fantastical elements slowly creeping in to give an idea of a slow descent into madness. Ordinary elements of the characters life are inherent in the rooms you find. The Matrix elements are the character's fantasy taking over. The programmer hints that it might be the programmer as the player. The dichotomy of programmer and programmed blurs. The existence of the computer game character is now the programmer's, endlessly repeating and ultimately doomed.
The game itself is an endless repetition. You are fated to continue playing. If you try to break the fate, you are confronted by thousands of parallel you's. Existence is purpose and purpose is existence - break your purpose and you annihilate your entire existence.
But what *is* your existence? Are you a person, dragged into this mess and forced to find a way out of the building? Are you the programmer, finding existence in your creation and limiting your own free will? Are you the program, playing out your existence, with an illusory free will? Do you have free will? Do you have an existence? Do you have purpose?
