You wrench your mind free, the tear leaving an ache and flashes of something you can't quite catch hold of (or maybe comprehend). Clasping a hand over your eyes, you wait a second as the pain subsides and your breathing softens. You slide your hand from your face, up slowly through your hair. Now what <i>were</i> you thinking of?

Despite your best and desperate attempts, you can't quite remember... All of a sudden, the room seems to fade in and you stop, quickly wiping away your wearied squint. Not breathing, you peer cautiously at your surroundings. With no explanation, you find yourself leaning against some crumbling wall, surrounded by delivery boxes. A cursory inspection suggests that this is a basement... But of where?

Confused, you scratch the back of your head, suddenly finding a scrap of paper clenched in your fist. Peering at it, your mind keeps grasping for answers, coming up with only more questions. Determined to work this one out, you push off the wall, stand up straight, and take a cautious breath and a better look around.
