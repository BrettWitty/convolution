The Great Phone ReReconstruction

- Make it of two parts: a handset and a box
- Make the handset zero weight, zero bulk
- Make the only allowable containers: PC, phone, lobby
  - If in the PC, you're listening to the phone
  - If in the phone, it's hung up
  - If in the lobby, it's dangling
- Have a list of call receivers (Vern, emergency, dial tone)
- If you put the handset on the hook, it automatically switches to dial tone. Removing the handset doesn't change the talker at all.
- Dialing goes for n rings and then initializes the hangup (internally).

Current state:
- Where am I?
- Who am I talking to?
- Pending call (only if handset on the phone, talker is not dial tone)
