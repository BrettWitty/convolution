The Agent Smith Scene: 

Agent Smith: Mr. Anderson.

Agent Smith: You got my package?

Neo: Yeah.

Agent Smith: Well good. 

(cut to Nebuchadnezzar)

Morpheus: Smith.

Link: Whoever it is, he's not reading like an agent.

(cut to Park)

Agent Smith: Surprised to see me?

Neo: No.

Agent Smith: Then you're aware of it.

Neo: Of what?

Agent Smith: Our connection.

Agent Smith: I don't fully understand how it happened, perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied. It is, at this point, irrelevant. What matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason.

Neo: And what reason is that?

Agent Smith: I killed you, Mr. Anderson, I watched you die. With a certain satisfaction, I might add. And then something happened... something I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do, but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. Now here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson. Because of you, I am no longer an agent of the system. Because of you, I changed, I am unplugged. A new man, so to speak. Like you, apparently free.

Neo: Congratulations.

Agent Smith: Thank you. But, as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We're not here because we're free, we're here because we're not free. There is no escaping reason, no denying purpose. Because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.

Agent Smith: It is purpose that created us.

Agent Smith: Purpose that connects us.

Agent Smith: Purpose that pulls us.

Agent Smith: That guides us.

Agent Smith: That drives us.

Agent Smith: It is purpose that defines.

Agent Smith: Purpose that binds us.

Agent Smith: We are here because of you, Mr. Anderson. We're here to take from you that which you've tried to take from us.

Agent Smith: Purpose.
