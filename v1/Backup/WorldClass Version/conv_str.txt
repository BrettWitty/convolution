You suddenly snap out of a train of thought, your head throbbing with pain and flashes of something you can't quite catch hold of (or maybe understand). Now what was that you were thinking of?\b Despite your best and desperate attempts, you can't quite remember... You stop and look around. Wait up, where the heck are you? You find yourself leaning against some crumbling wall, surrounded by delivery boxes. A cursory inspection suggests that this is a basement... But of what? And where?\b You knuckle your head in confusion, suddenly noticing a scrap of paper in your fist. You stand up straight, take a cautious breath and a better look around...\b\b\b

By Brett Witty\b
This is my maiden effort, although not my first exposure to IF programming (look for Shorokin on LambdaMOO). Convolution began in January of 2004 and ended some time after that. The game was mapped out and plotted before being committed to code. It originally began in a shareware version of ADRIFT, but obviously needed a better system. Some of the locations were produced in vanilla TADS, but I soon switched over to WorldClass and haven't looked back since.\b
Playtesters:\n
\t None yet.\b
Thanks go to:\n
\t My friends\n
\t Michael J.\ Roberts for TADS\n
\t David M.\ Baggett and David Haire for WorldClass\n
\t My usual sources of inspiration: Alan Watts, The Wachowski Brothers, Douglas Adams, Monkey Punch and the rest.\n
\t William Shakespeare, for his insistence on appearing in almost every project I undertake, despite my best attempts to shake him.\n
\t My thesaurus and dictionary (of the good ol' paper variety). Thanks for the suggestions.\n
\t The IF community for supporting the art form so thoroughly.\b
And now for the serious credits:\b

Something is definitely off-putting about the letter. It has been printed immaculately (almost mechanically) on professional onion-skin paper, closed with three sharp, neat folds. The letter itself is as deliberate as the presentation --- three punchy lines of text with no signature. Most intriguingly, it's addressed to you. 
You unfold the letter and notice immediately it has been addressed to you. You read further:\b\b\b\t Now that you are up and about, you are invited to see us upstairs to try again to resolve this matter.\b\t Room 808.\b\b\b What the hell? Resolve what matter? Why don't they just let you out of here? You fold up the letter and put it away, shaking your head in disbelief.

This hint book is designed to be a portable way of receiving hints without breaking the virtual reality. It works like a book. Use the 'turn hint book to n' to go to Section n. Enter n as a number like 1 or 6. To read the current section, type 'read hint book'.\b The book does not automatically (by default) read the page when you turn to a new section, so you don't accidentally see hints if you mistype the section number. If you want the book to automatically read the section, type 'push automatic reading button'. Push the button again to revert to the default behaviour. The red light on the book indicates the current setting.\b You can open and close the book. Closing it loses your place (reopening the book brings you to the contents page).\b Every so often, the hint book will hum if it has added a new hint. You can turn off the hum by 'turn off hint book'. If you miss the humming, use 'turn on hint book'.\b Don't worry about losing this book. You can use 'summon hint book' to magically bring it to your person (regardless of where it was). You can't break the hint book though you can try if you like.

Vern the Janitor
Vern is your typical hard-working, underpaid, underappreciated janitor. He has a big bushy moustache that gives him an air of seriousness, or more likely, it muffles his occasional muttered curses. He wears a wearied set of (once) blue overalls discoloured with hundreds of exotic stains - the product of years of custodial service. 
Vern the Janitor mills about, fixing this or that. 
Vern mumbles, "No thanks."

There are the various brown-black splotches on the chest, a couple of chemical discolorations here and there, and the legs are a darker, sedimentary colour from the knees down (as though he had done some muck-wading on occasions). You even notice the occasional mustard stain down the front.\b 
Vern gives you a querulous look in response to your staring. 
Vern looks down at his overalls, wondering if you'd spotted something embarrassing that he hadn't. 
Vern shifts slightly and puts his hands in front of him, trying to break your intrusive staring.

Behind a bunch of boxes
You find yourself surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of boxes. This storage area seems to be tucked away in some mouldy corner of a basement somewhere. Murky light seeps in from the small, dusty window near the ceiling. 
The boxes lie in neat stacks around you, except for a few small random piles near the cleared way to the north. 
You deftly weave a way through the cardboard boxes out into... \b

the boxes
The boxes seem to be unopened delivery boxes, piled high in vaguely ordered way. They surround you in a creepy "fort of postal rejects" way.
Except for a small passage to the east, the boxes surround you.
The delivery boxes are piled up all around you, except for a tight passage to the east and a small cleared way to a door to the north.
Hundreds of names are scribbled on the delivery boxes - some that sound vaguely familiar, others that definitely don't and many more that you can't even read (unless their names contain very few vowels...)
As much as your heart desires to stand gloriously atop these Boxes Of Delivery, vanquishing them with your magnificent mountaineering skills, the ceiling is way too low and you doubt whether they could hold you (reliably). 
Try as you might, you can't seem to stack any boxes flat enough to be appropriate for lying on!
You try lying on a few boxes that don't look too bad... Unfortunately, one of them make a horrible crunch sound when you put your weight on it. You roll away and figure you'd be better off in your current position.
Figuring you have nothing better to do, you start getting ready for a good ol' lie down, but then you realize, you DO have something better to do!
You sit on one of the boxes and ponder your predicament.

You prepare to give the boxes a solid shove, when then the word "avalanche" comes to mind. You can think of more glamorous ways to die and so leave the boxes be.

The window seems to be completely covered in grime from the outside. There is no way to open the window. Anyway, it's too small to squeeze through.
The Basement
Quite obviously, this is a basement. Even more clearly, the place isn't regularly used - dust and spiderwebs decorate the place. Cardboard boxes are stacked high to the west and you think you can see a narrow path through them. There is a small metal door to the south and stairs leading upwards to the east.
The floor is quite dusty, except for the clear track from the stairs to the door to the south. Other than that, it's unremarkable, worn cement.

The door seems very much locked.

This is a back room that lies north from what seems to be a reception area.

Not effectively, mind you.\b Just beyond a few boxes correctly placed to trip an unwary traveller lies a set of stairs heading west, down into the basement. A fortified emergency exit lies to the north.
You step cautiously down the stairs into the basement. It takes a while for your eyes to adjust.\b

The arrangement of these boxes is clearly the product of hastiness or laziness. Or both. Some boxes are all stacked askew, arranging themselves according to gravity. Others seem to be stacked with good intention - one box has its "This way up" arrow pointing directly down, a small box supports a larger and heavier one... You're sure that in the right gallery this would be an avante-garde centerpiece of great distinction. Lying in this back room they have been demoted to "clutter". 
The boxes that immediately catch your eye do not keep your interest - you do not feel you need them.

busted-up chair
Some things in this world sure got the rough end of the stick in terms of their existence: mayflies, dung beetles, New Coke(tm) and this chair. It began its life as one of those dime-a-dozen, plastic-backed, unergonomic chairs that they often use for school assemblies or town meetings. They are produced en masse with cheap (foreign) labour; they only require screwing two bent pieces of metal to the plastic seat. Unfortunately, their cheap manufacture seems to induce enraged people to hurl them at walls, lazy people to snap their backs via creative postures and fat people to accidentally crush them. This specimen has had its seat warped and its legs bent and snapped off. It lies in a tangle heap of plastic and metal in one corner of the room. If it wasn't just a stupid chair, you might shed a tear for its beleaguered existence. 
You think about taking this tangle of plastic and metal, but it doesn't serve its intended purpose - you couldn't possibly sit on it - nor does it lend itself to convenient carrying. You are sure your creativity stops well short of being able to make this busted up chair useful.

the emergency exit
Whoever runs this place must have forgotten the purpose of this emergency exit. The doorway is fairly wide so you guess they may have used this as the main delivery point - scratches of paint and blunt gouges in the metal frame seem to confirm this theory. However they must have found a better way and subsequently locked this door permanently. It looks solid enough to shrug off any axe-wielding maniac, and even seems to be doing a good job against the occasional rust stain. Trying to shove this door open would be a recipe for a broken shoulder. You dread to think what the fire safety inspectors would make of it. 
You rattle the door bar, but the door doesn't even make a pretence of being able to open. 
You would probably need a special key and an unbelievable amount of strength to open this door. You have neither.

 to little effect - the door bar rattles a little, but the door itself seems too strong to let your knocking through. 
The Reception
The reception office seems to be rarely used. It has the usual assortment of administrative stuff strewn about, but has that "I'll be right back in a month or so" look to it. Between the mess and the filing cabinets is an important-looking door to the east. Otherwise, a plain-looking door to the north leads out the back and you spot the main lobby to the south.
The Lobby
You swear you've seen this lobby a million times before - probably in various movies. It seems more like an apartment lobby than a lobby for an office building or hotel. There is a seventies-style elevator to the west, the entrance to the south, the reception to the north and a hallway leading off to the east.
The Entrance
The entrance area is only lit by the light coming in off the street and some of the fluoros in the lobby to the north. It would probably give the residents a glum welcoming as they checked their mail. Nevertheless, the janitor keeps the place presentable, despite the bad architectural design. There is a set of closed glass doors to the south that lead out to the street. 
To your surprise, the doors have been chained shut!

In an elegant calligraphic font below the design are the initials CT. The whole thing is very expensive and elaborate, but of no use to anybody!
Ground floor hallway
This hallway slinks off to the side of the lobby. Some effort has been made to jazz up the hallway with the an obligatory scattering of paintings and so forth, but it does feel a little underachieved. At the eastern end of the hallway there is a stairwell leading up and immediately to the south is a swinging door labelled "Laundry". Alternatively you can return to the lobby to the west.

Ground floor stairwell
The stairwell is your usual spartan concrete fire escape, lit with cold fluorescent lights. The stairs only lead up (as indicated by the sign). Alternatively, you can walk out into the hallway to the west. The hallway seems to lead out into the lobby.

You guess he would have wanted to install a grand oak door with intricate and powerful carvings, but budget and space was tight so all he got has an extra coat of shellac on the door (plus the spiffy gold-plated sign). 
Surprisingly, the door is open, inviting like the mouth of a venus fly trap.
Nevertheless it is firmly shut, clearly demonstrating the line between the power and the plebs.

End of the Alleyway
The alleyway ends abruptly here as the building to the south (where you have come from) turns north to nestle itself between two other buildings. There isn't as much rubbish here as the rest of the alleyway to the east, but that's relative. However, there is enough grime to make up for it. \n To the south and west the base of the walls are dirty windows, although the southern ones are so short to be almost useless.

You can't see much through the grime encrusted on the window. 
The windows set into the base of the western wall have been smashed and cleared out. You still can't see much in the room beyond, but you can smell a certain staleness above the odours of the alleyway.
The windows to the west have been smashed and the broken shards of glass litter the window sill and the surrounding ground. The facade of broken glass and darkness beyond is a little creepy. 
You don't think you can get the window any cleaner (given the surrroundings).
You vigorously rub the window clean of the grime and muck. Your hand ends up with all the gunk, so you wipe them on the wall. 
Watching carefully for any more broken glass, you slide yourself through the window into the dark room below.

The windows are so small and dirty, you hardly see the point. 
alleyway
Dirty Alleyway
You find yourself in a slightly broad alleyway running east-west. The soot-stained brick walls are streaked with rust stains and mould, decorated with a few obligatory spritzes of graffiti. A jumbled pile of garbage sits against the north wall, and reeks of a diverse array of mixed unpleasant odours. Water from various drainpipies and the occasional rain storm has soaked through the refuse, creating an ooze that has creeped across the alleyway making the ground underfoot slippery. Some of the slime has trickled into a few small drains near the base of the walls. Above you there is a fire escape, and to the south three steps lead up to a reinforced steel door. Otherwise this mess of an alleyway continues both east and west.
The slime from the garbage has oozed its way across the alleyway and trickled down a small drain. 
A set of footprints leading eastward have tracked through the slime. 
A set of footprints leading westward have tracked through the slime. 
The slime has been muddled up with footprints going in all directions. 
The crumbling brick walls are coated with grime and mould. Rust streaks down the wall from the joins of the metal brackets holding the drains and fire escape up. A few splashes of graffiti complete the wall's grotty appearance.
The overpowering stench of the garbage hangs in the air here. 
You can hear the occasional dripping drain amidst the quiet trickle of one particular drain that opens over the garbage. Other than that, there is an uneasy silence.

The huge steel door to the south looks very much like the other side of the door you saw in the back room. This side has its share of rust blotches and cracked blue paint. Someone has recently spray-painted a gang sign on the door, over all the discolorations and cracks. 
Chips of blue paint crumble beneath your fingers. The cold metal frame is abrasive from the peeling paint and the dried rust.\b You look at your fingers and brush the junk off.
Didn't your mother tell you about eating paint chips?
You gingerly sniff the door, accidentally inhaling a tiny paint fleck. You stagger backwards, trying to sneeze. After thrashing about for a little while, you blow it out and stand back, rubbing your nose. 
You try to push open the door but it barely rattles in response.
Even if that could actually unlock the door, the lock has been plugged up with a decades-old, rock-hard piece of chewing gum. Nevertheless, you have little faith that you have, or even could have, the appropriate key. 
Despite your best attempts, the door will not open. 
You knock on the metal door, hurting your knuckles. What's worse it that you doubt anyone heard it. 
Being more careful this time, you bash on the door with your fist. The dull thumps go unanswered. 
You thump on the door with your fist. The echoes die away, yet no-one answers the door.

You're not sure you can differentiate between the stink of the slime and the garbage. After all, the slime is just the liquid form of the garbage. 
Try as you might, you cannot hear the slow march of the slime across the alleyway. 
There are more futile activities around, but not many. 
Have you gone completely mad?! This is <I>slime</I>, on the <I>ground</I>, in a <I>disgusting alleyway!</I> 
Even though the slime is sloppy enough to try to drink, you think you better not. 
Scooping up the slime and slathering it all over yourself doesn't seem like the smartest idea at the moment.

The pipes that collect runoff from above and drain out into the alleyway are more suggestions of drainage than actual examples of such. They are attached to the brick by a few bolts and a prayer. Some have rusted through, whilst others have buckled in places. 
The drain's smell is a unique blend of mould, muddy water and sharply metallic rust. 
The rusty metal is slightly rough. After you remove your fingers from the drain, it suddenly shifts and you back away before it collapses on you. 
You prefer to guess that it tastes metallic rather than test that theory. 
You hear an interesting mix of echoing drips, trickles and the wind whipping past the end of the drain. 
Although your fall would probably be buffeted by the garbage piles, you don't want to risk climbing the frail pipes. 
You think it unwise to pull down the drains. It'd ruin the whole aesthetic! 
You peer inside the drain, but only see the trickle of dirty water. 
You look at the dirty water dribbling from the drain and decide not to.

For whatever reason, someone chose this area to dump their refuse and everyone else has followed suit. The mound of garbage consists of table scraps, plastic bags spilling out their junky insides, torn up boxes, smashed up furniture and mind-bogglingly unidentifiable other stuff. The whole mess is sodden with water spilled onto it by the drains. A vacation site only Oscar the Grouch could love. 
You take a big whiff of the garbage and are rewarded with nothing either unexpected or appealing. 
Just as you expected - it feels like squishy, slimy, dirty garbage. 
You wouldn't taste the garbage on a dare. 
You put your ear near the garbage, expecting to hear the ocean. No wait, that's seashells. 
This is one mountain you wouldn't want to conquer.
You are neither a goat nor a contestant on a reality TV show. You leave the garbage uneaten. 
Although your civic pride is admirable, you doubt you could do much better than relocating the garbage from here to somewhere nearby. It isn't worth the effort. 
Seriously, you can't possibly want to carry around any of this junk. It doesn't even have sentimental value! 
You have searched through the garbage as much as you can stomach. 
You gingerly poke through the refuse, hoping to find something worthwhile. You were too hopeful. 
You prod the garbage with your shoe but you don't uncover anything interesting (or appetising).
You give the garbage a hefty booting, but are only rewarded with a dull squish. You wipe a piece of junk off your shoe onto the wall. 
You think about giving the garbage a bunch of fives, but figure it'd probably give you tetanus in return. 
Even if there was some hidden pathway underneath all that rubbish (which there isn't), you feel that burying yourself in the garbage is A Bad Thing(tm). 
You already have a fine set of clothes and don't need to resort to wearing slimy, rotten plastic bags. 
The squishy garbage might be comfortable, but you figure you wouldn't want an embarrassing smudge on the seat of your pants.

graffiti
In the usual weird style of the "street-artist", the graffiti is made up of various "tags", some readable some not. A few of the pieces of graffiti look to be quite old and have faded substantially. 
One slapdash effort in red looks like it says, "murder.com". 
In one corner someone has painted a doped-up looking smiley face with suggestive lackadaisical soft lines. 
In several little nooks and crannies, someone has used a marker to write their tag but you have no idea what it says. Maybe the guy's name is "Wiggly line"? 
Someone has prominently sprayed "FACK" on the south wall. Weird. 
An immature someone has spray-painted a woman near the garbage in a very unsubtle pose. 
On a large piece of piping you barely make out some small, rambling essay written on with a marker. You think it's something about the government and other scoundrels.

If you're trying to get high by licking old paint, you may want to reconsider your life. 
The paint smell is long gone and would still be overpowered by the garbage even if it hadn't.
You listen to what the graffiti has to say (metaphorically) but decide not to follow up on its crude directions. 
Your civic pride is admirable, but cleaning up one scrap of graffiti here would leave countless more unassailed. Plus, if you want to be do something for your community you should do it where everyone can see you doing it. 
"Mess up my buildings, eh? Take that!" you shout, assailing the wall. The graffiti seems unaffected by your well-intentioned attack.

Three squat concrete steps lead up to the reinforced door to the south. The stairs themselves are unremarkable - their most interesting features are the scuff marks and chips in the concrete. 
You run your fingers along the rough surface of the stairs, leaving a (relatively) clear line through the dust. 
You wait patiently for the steps to make some noise. You eventually stop, disappointed but unsurprised. 
Alleyway stairs are a delicacy you choose to be ignorant of. 
You can't smell anything over the pungent aroma of the garbage. 
Fenced end of the alleyway
This section of the backstreet is a little less rubbish-ridden than the areas to the west, mostly because it is not quite a pocket for garbage to collect in, and partly because of luck. The alleyway continues on to the east before turning south to somewhere brighter, to the main street you guess. But you may find out because a high chain-link fence cuts across the alleyway to your immediate east. Alternatively, to the north is rear entrance, or you can revisit the refuse to the west.
Sporadic breezes wending their way from the east whisk away the stench of the rubbish, but replace it with the cold, lifeless smell of concrete. 
Other than faint dripping to the west and the gentle whistle of wind through the fence, this place is oddly quiet. Not even a whisper of traffic or the commotion of the city. Weird. 
You can't venture eastwards with that fence blocking your way!

The definite impassability of the whole fence is disheartening. 
You catch a whiff of some of the breezes whistling through the fence. All smell like bland, cold concrete.
The breeze whistles through the fence as though it had nothing better to do. The fence clinks as it sways in the occasional stronger gusts. 
You cautiously give a quick lick to a seemingly clean section of the fence. The steel taste is unsatisfying and you feel foolish.

You shake the fence to only dramatic effect.

First Floor Stairwell
The first floor stairwell is much the same as the ground floor. In fact, you're willing to bet they're all like that. Architects and their interest in repetition... When will they learn? There is a small sign on the wall and a doorway to the west opening up into a hallway.
The ground is nicely smoothed concrete. Very professional once laid, dangerous when wet.

First floor hallway
This is the east end of the first floor's hallway. The hallway continues westwards with its chalky grey paint and wearied rust-coloured carpet before turning northwards to much of the same, presumably. There are two doorways here, leading west and north. The doorway to the west leads into a concrete stairwell. The fluorescent lighting isn't particularly elegant or inviting. 
Almost correspondingly, the room to the north is lit in a dreary green-grey fluorescence. It seems to be a lunch room. The ordinary lighting in the hallway is cosy in comparison. 
In comparison, the ordinary hallway lighting is strangely comforting. The plain blue-grey door to the north is closed. 
The light rust-coloured carpet here is of the tough, compacted kind. It seems to be in good shape, discounting the usual wear and tear due to traffic. 
The hallway has been painted a pale, chalky grey. You guess this wasn't a well-intentioned choice by the architect, more a "just the usual, thanks" decision. Periodically along the walls there are circular lights that illuminate the hallway. Despite being rather plain, the hallway is well-maintained, to its credit.
You stare at the ceiling for a while, trying to find inspiration amongst the plain white paint. You find nothing. 
Lunch room
You guess this must be for the lower-rung employees. The room is almost entirely made of drab linoleum and has a faint artificial lemon-scented floor cleaner smell to it. The single light above is so old that it emits a weird green-grey light, not helping the atmosphere at all. The door to the south is 
held open by a hook latching it to the wall
closed, revealing a poster
.
The floor is made out of grey and brown flecked linoleum tiles. A few smudges and stains hide in nooks and crannies where the cleaners couldn't (or couldn't be bothered to) get to. 
The stale linoleum smell is almost saturated in the lemon-scented floor cleaner that they obviously use here.

You open the door. It swings wide open with little effort on your behalf. 
You shut the door with a light push. You notice a poster stuck on the back of the door.

poster
Stuck to the back of the door is a motivational poster for the cleaners. It looks like it survived the Cold War. The poster is divided into two pictures top and bottom, divided by a line of bold text. The top picture is a beautiful, enthusiastic young woman merrily pushing a mop around. Below it is a frumpy old woman slouching over a cup of coffee, a crumpled cigarette hanging from her sour mouth. The big block letters between them asks, "What is your purpose here?" \b You wouldn't be surprised to see a little line saying "Brought to you by the Nazi Work Ethics Committee."
