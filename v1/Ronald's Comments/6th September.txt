A couple of things I have just spottedddd

In the Entrance
>take keys
The word "keys" is not necessary in this story.

>touch Vern
You feel nothing out of the ordinary. 

I 'read' the microwave, which makes me all the more hungry to nuke
stuff (i liked it better when i had a coin to nuke): but i haven't
figured out if that is possible yet.

>read coffee machine
A bulky grey automatic coffee machine fills in some of the space
between the sink and the microwave. The grey plastic is sickly under
this light. A small scrap of paper has been taped to the machine,
reading:
"Machine broke. Mngmt order new one."
 Tough break...

>take paper
You see no paper here. [I ripped up my own paper, as you suggested,
but there is paper on the coffee machine]

I found a piece of paper in a kitchen (and a piece of card in Cody's
bedroom). Suddenly I am reminded of 'Hotel California' by the Eagles.

I met the guy in the far apartment. He's friendly...

>guy, hi!
The guy interrupts you. "Dude, I don't think I even know you. Intro yourself!" 

>introduce self
"Er, hi..." you say....

>take skis
[Runtime error: nil object reference]

I get stuck by entering the elevator ("west") on the first floor, as well.
