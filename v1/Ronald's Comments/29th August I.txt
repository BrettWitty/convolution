I've explored the first three rooms - behind the boxes, the basement
and boiler room. I am carrying on testing while doing other things, so
it's easier for me at the moment to send you a partial transcript of
when-things-went-bad with my comments in square brackets. Let me know
if you prefer me to do anything else - perhaps a shorter summary, it's
no problem.

<b>Behind a bunch of boxes</b>
>push/pull/move boxes
The pile of boxes cannot be moved. [false statement]

>look at wall
For a stretch of maybe a few metres wide, the west wall is free of
boxes, revealing the dry bricks and dust. The bricks are so dry and
old that they crumble under any moderate force, which has left them
with a rough texture over the years.
>push bricks
The word "bricks" is not necessary in this story. [noun request - bricks]

>look at window
Above the skyline of boxes, just below the ceiling, a thin row of
windows span the entirety of the north wall. Murky light seeps through
the dusty panes, illuminating this nook of the basement.
[in the description of the room, it would seem there is only one
window - here, a row of windows is described]

>examine beam
As if it were orchestrated that way, the boxes block out some of the
light to form a solid beam illuminating the entrance of the passage
leading out. Blurry bars of light shine through the cracks of boxes,
breaking up over others. [...cracks of boxes?]
>look at entrance
You see no entrance here. [noun request - entrance]
>look at passage
A tight passage wends its way east through the boxes , presumably out
to the main room.
[space before comma]

>east
<b>Basement</b>

>look at brick wall
You see no brick wall here. [false]

>look at wall
Which wall do you mean, the north wall, the south wall, the east wall,
or the west wall?
[... it turns out that none of the walls are described here (although
the north wall has been mentioned as interesting; and should the west
wall even be visible?), so this disambiguation feels awkward]


>kick boxes
You shouldn't kick that. [I could kick them before!]

>look at dust
The dust seems to have settled in well here, except for a clear track
from the stairs to the metal door to the south.
>look at track
The word "track" is not necessary in this story. [maybe true, but it's
something interesting]

>look at metal door
The sturdy metal door is shut. Scratched into the middle of it is the
word "Janitor". No prizes for whose room lies beyond.
It's closed.
>examine scratches
You see no scratches here. [*sulk*!]

>north
<b>The Boiler Room</b>

>touch boiler
You feel nothing out of the ordinary. ["ow!"?]

>kiss boiler
Kissing the the boiler has no obvious effect. [hmm... i'm trying to
injure myself here! it lets me kiss the boiler?!]

>kick boiler
You shouldn't kick that. [no "thunk!"? but this is a fair enough response]

>listen
You hear nothing out of the ordinary. [but the boiler bubbles away
obediently.. i'm almost sorry for you that i tried this!]

>look at metal
You see no metal here. [literally false; the boiler is metal (i was
checking to see if i could pull of any metal strips, sorry again)]

>look at pipes
You see no pipes here. [noun request - pipes]

>look at vents
The word "vents" is not necessary in this story.
