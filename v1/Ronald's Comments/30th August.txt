OK. I'm using 1.21... Good Work!
I'll come back to the first 3 rooms at another point, but I thought it
would be better to move on for now. You'll notice that I had major
problems with the phone. So...

>e,e,s
<b>Reception</b>

Over the front counter to the south you spy a small phone. It rings loudly. 
>look at phone
You see no phone here. 
>look at counter  [same with "mess", "filing cabinets", "office",
"stuff", "administrative stuff"]
The word "counter" is not necessary in this story.
>look at door
{describes the manager's door, but the plain-looking door to the north
is forgotten}
>search room
You see no room here. [stupid TADS]

Basically I can't find anything of interest in this room. Sorry! On we
go, anyway...

>s
<b>The Lobby</b>
>look at carpet [corner, hallway, door, elevator, window, reception
window, shadows,
You see no carpet here.
>search fern
There's nothing unusual in the decorative potted fern. [not gramatically sound?]

>kick fern
{it falls over}
>look at fern
{no mention of it having fallen - described as "proud, tall"}

>press phone [or take, etc.]
The lobby phone is too heavy. [Is it really heavy? or more unmoveable]

>dial 101 [call, ring, phone]
The story doesn't understand that command.

>hang up phone
(first putting the handset on the hook)
You put the handset back on the hook. 

(first putting the handset on the hook)
You put the handset back on the hook. 

(first putting the handset on the hook)
You put the handset back on the hook. 

{Infinite loop}

>put phone on hook
You can't do that while the hook is in the lobby phone. 

The phone stutters out a faint dial tone. 
{although it gave me an Infinite loop before as well}

>put coin in phone
You can't put anything in the lobby phone. 

So, I can't figure out how to dial out or pay for the phone, basically
:( am i missing something obvious?

Next I'm going to play with the elevator, ok?
