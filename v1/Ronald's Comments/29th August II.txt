>listen
You hear nothing out of the ordinary. 
You can hear a phone ringing somewhere to the south. [Contradiction]

>kick boxes
You shouldn't kick that. [bah!]

>look at furniture
{description of a particular chair} 
[Perhaps worth pointing out that a particular chair catches our eye

is strewn around. Otherwise change the room description to refer to an
abandoned chair?]

>sit on chair
That isn't something you can sit on. 
[LOL. I actually like this statement a lot. I put it here because you
