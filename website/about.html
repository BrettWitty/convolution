    <h1>About Convolution</h1>

<table align="center" border="2" width="75%" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellspacing="9" cellpadding="9">
<tr><td><h3>The General Idea</h3>
<P>Convolution is a game of exploration. Exploration of location and of theme. I've given the game a healthy dose of puzzles, but they aren't intended to tear your brain asunder. I prefer realistic or clever solutions over obscure or silly solutions. Thus you will not open doors with a carp (or will you?) but you may be able to resolve situations in unexpected ways. Feel free to push the limits.</p>

<P>I've designed most of puzzles to be solvable in several different ways so you can try *your* solution rather than a particular one the author would prefer. Moreover, you can avoid some puzzles completely, taking alternative routes through the game.</p>

<p>There are several Easter eggs hidden about the place. Try to find them all!</p>


<h3>The Plot</h3>

Due to the exploratory nature of the game, I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but here is the introduction:

<BLOCKQUOTE>You suddenly snap out of a train of thought, your head throbbing with pain and flashes of something you can't quite catch hold of (or maybe understand). Now what was that you were thinking of? 

<P>Despite your best and desperate attempts, you can't quite remember... You stop and look around. Wait up, where the heck are you? You find yourself leaning against some crumbling wall, surrounded by delivery boxes. A cursory inspection suggests that this is a basement... But of what? And where?</p>

<p>You knuckle your head in confusion, suddenly noticing a scrap of paper in your fist. You stand up straight, take a cautious breath and a better look around...</p></blockquote>

<h3>What else?</h3>

<P>Well, Convolution is my maiden effort in Interactive Fiction programming. It was written by just me (Brett Witty) over a period of maybe 9 months (so it's my baby :) ). It is written in TADS 3 (after beginning several times in several different IF languages). I decided not to include any multimedia and to focus solely on the literary abilities of the game.</P>

<P>It began as an idle game idea, basically designed for me to practice my programming and have some fun before I worked on The Real Game. Originally it was a goofy, whimsical sort of game with no name and no merits at all. The plan involved a whole heap of random elements strung together without any real rhyme or reason. After getting some cool ideas, it earnt the name "Convolution", as well as a plot/theme and some seriousness. The jury is still out on the "merit" question, but I feel like it is a reasonably solid offering. It is basically the game I'd like to play: it is detailed, has a strong theme, offers multiple solutions and paths to the end, and rewards exploration. I hope it lives up to my expectations :)</p>

<h3>What next?</h3>

<P>I have a few other ideas in the pipeline, but Convolution is to be finished first. If I get it in on time for IFComp 04, then I'd like to release a post-competition version including maybe extra puzzles and bugfixes. I'd love to do a "Director's Cut", if I had the time, patience and demand. But one step at a time...
